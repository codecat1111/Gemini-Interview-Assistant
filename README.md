## Features in Detail

### Recording Controls

- Start/Stop Recording button
- New Recording button for multiple attempts
- Reset Session button to clear history

### Analysis Options

- Real-time transcription
- AI-powered feedback
- Compare mode for self-assessment
- Session history tracking

### History Feature

The application maintains a history of interview responses:

- "Start Recording (No History)" - Begins a new recording without considering previous responses
- "New Recording (With History)" - Saves the current analysis to history before starting a new recording
- History is automatically included in AI analysis for context
- Reset Session button clears all history

### Theme Support

- Toggle between dark and light modes
- Theme preference is saved automatically
- Consistent styling across all components
- Accessible color schemes for better readability

## Model Setup

### Loading the Whisper Model

The application uses the Whisper-tiny model for speech transcription. On first run, the model will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face.

```python
# Initialize Whisper model
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-tiny")
model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-tiny")
```

## Virtual Audio Cable Setup and Live Transcription

### 1. Setting Up VB-Audio Virtual Cable

This project utilizes VB-Audio Virtual Cable to capture system audio and process live transcriptions.

#### 1.1 Installation

- Download VB-Audio Virtual Cable from the [official website](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
- Extract and install by running `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` (for 64-bit systems)
- Restart your computer to ensure the changes take effect

#### 1.2 Configuring VB-Audio Virtual Cable

1. Open Sound Settings in Windows (Win + I â†’ "Sound")
2. Under Output Devices:
   - Set "CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)" as default output
3. Under Input Devices:
   - Select "CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)" as microphone input
4. (Optional) Use VoiceMeeter Banana for advanced routing if needed

### 2. System Audio Capture Implementation

The application includes built-in functions to detect and record system audio through VB-Audio Virtual Cable.

#### 2.1 Virtual Cable Device Detection

```python
def find_vb_audio_device():
    """Finds VB-Audio Virtual Cable device ID"""
    devices = sd.query_devices()
    for i, device in enumerate(devices):
        if "CABLE Output" in device["name"]:
            return i
    return None
```

#### 2.2 Audio Recording System

```python
class SystemAudioRecorder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sample_rate = 16000
        self.recording = False
        self.audio_data = []

    def start_recording(self):
        device_id = find_vb_audio_device()
        if device_id is None:
            raise RuntimeError("VB-Audio Virtual Cable not found!")

        self.recording = True
        self.audio_data = []

        def audio_callback(indata, frames, time, status):
            if self.recording:
                self.audio_data.append(indata.copy())

        self.stream = sd.InputStream(
            device=device_id,
            channels=1,
            samplerate=self.sample_rate,
            callback=audio_callback
        )
        self.stream.start()

    def stop_recording(self):
        self.recording = False
        self.stream.stop()
        self.stream.close()
        audio_data = np.concatenate(self.audio_data, axis=0)
        filename = "recorded_audio.wav"
        sf.write(filename, audio_data, self.sample_rate)
        return filename
```

### Troubleshooting Virtual Audio Cable

1. **No Audio Detected:**

   - Verify "CABLE Input" is set as default playback device
   - Check "CABLE Output" is selected as recording input
   - Ensure system volume is not muted

2. **Device Not Found:**

   - Restart the VB-Audio service
   - Reinstall the drivers if necessary
   - Check Device Manager for any warning icons

3. **Poor Audio Quality:**
   - Verify sample rate settings match (16000 Hz)
   - Check for system CPU usage
   - Close unnecessary audio applications
